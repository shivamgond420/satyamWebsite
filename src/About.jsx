            He began his journey in gaming in the mid-2010s and quickly amassed
            a huge following because of his engaging content.

            He was among the first generation of gamers who began researching
            multiple titles rather than just mastering one, and he was also
            among the Indian gaming pioneers who ventured into tutorial-making
            for budding amateur gamers.

            “From childhood, I had a love for gaming. I’d take someone else’s
            mobile to play or spend hours on my family PC; those were my early
            days. Then I realised that people upload their gaming videos online.
            Back then, my friends thought that I was a great gamer and looked to
            me for tips. Encouraged by that, I started making tutorial videos
            for my friends, to teach them,” says Techno Gamerz about the birth
            of his gaming identity.
